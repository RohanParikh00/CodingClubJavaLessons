//Java Coding Circle Lesson 1

//This is a comment.
//Comments are identified by two forward slashes ('/').
//Comments are ignored by java and are usually used to provide information about what's going on.
//The comments throughout this lesson will be used to guide you through this lesson

//This is an import statement.
//Import statements are used to utilize outside classes.
//Import statements always go at the top of your code.
//This import statement imports the Scanner class. This will be used later in the lesson.
import java.util.Scanner;

//This is your class.
//The class is where you will have all of your code.
//The class must always start with a capital letter and cannot contain any spaces.
//The name of the class also has to match the name of your file.
public class Lesson01
{
	//This is the main method.
	//The main method is the only method that will execute when you hit run.
	//The main method should always be set up like this.
	public static void main(String args[])
	{
		//Print out the number 1.

		//TRY IT: Predict then print "Orca".




		//Create a String variable called whale and set it equal to "Orca".

		//Create an integer variable called number_of_whales and set it equal to 10.

		//Create a double variable called weightOf1Whale and set it equal to 5003.2.

		//Print out number_of_whales.

		//TRY IT: Assign the name of a sea creature to the variable seaCreature. Then print the value.


		
		//Create an integer called apples and set it equal to 15.

		//Create an integer called applesLeft and set it equal to 3 less than apples.

		//Print applesLeft.

		//Set number_of_whales equal to itself plus 2.

		//TRY IT: Find the result of 6*18.



		//Create an int called orderOfOps and set it equal to 2*3+4/2.

		//Print orderOfOps.

		//Create an int called modulusTest and set it equal to 5%2.

		//Print modulusTest.

		//TRY IT: Find if 12342872 is divisible by 3.

		

		//Print "Hello " and "Coding Circle" using concatenation.

		//Print "The ", whale variable you made earlier, and " lives in the sea" using concatenation.

		//TRY IT: Print out Good morning to the sea creature you stored in variable named sea_creature earlier.

		

		//Create a scanner object called scan.

		//Prompt the user to give their name.

		//Change the value of myName to something new using your scanner object.

		//Print out your new value for myName.

		//TRY IT: Prompt the user for their favorite color and store the value in a variable called color.



		//TRY IT: Write a comment.
