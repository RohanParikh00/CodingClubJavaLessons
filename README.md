# Coding Club Java Lessons

This has all the Java Lessons that are the Python Lesson equivalents for new programmers in the club. 

Open the notes file for each lesson first, and use the java file with the name "Lesson\_\_" to learn the items taught in the lesson, and then complete the project before you move on to the next lesson.
